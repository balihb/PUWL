# PUWL – P-EADCA Universal Waiver License

This repository contains the full text of **PUWL v1.0** in the file [LICENSE](LICENSE).

## License

The PUWL text itself is released under **PUWL v1.0**.

Origin project: [P-EADCA](https://github.com/balihb/P-EADCA)

## Philosophy

PUWL – **P-EADCA Universal Waiver License** – was created to remove
every possible legal barrier between the author and anyone using the work.

The intent is:

- **Total waiver:** the author waives **all rights** that can be waived in every legal jurisdiction.
- **No liability:** the author also **disclaims all responsibility** for how the work is used or misused.
- **Universal fallback:** in countries where a full waiver is not legally recognized,
  PUWL falls back to a royalty-free, non-exclusive, irrevocable license granting the broadest possible freedoms.
- **Maximum freedom:** users may copy, modify, redistribute, and reuse the work for any purpose,
  commercial or non-commercial, without asking for permission.

PUWL exists for people who simply want to say:
> “Take it, use it, do whatever you want – I have no strings attached.”

## Releasing new code under PUWL in a new fork of a repository

If you add PUWL to a project that already has another license
(e.g. Apache 2.0), copy this file under a distinct name such as
`LICENSE.puwl` to avoid conflicts.

Add the following in the header of the new files:

```text
# Licensed under the P-EADCA Universal Waiver License (PUWL v1.0)
# See LICENSE.puwl in the project root for details.
```
