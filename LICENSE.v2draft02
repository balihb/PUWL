The author of all original material in this work irrevocably releases it
for unrestricted worldwide use by anyone, for any purpose.
If this is not legally possible under the laws of the jurisdiction where the work is used,
the author releases all original material in this work to the public domain.
If, under any applicable law, a full public-domain dedication is not legally valid,
the author instead provides every person everywhere with a free, perpetual,
non-exclusive and irrevocable permission to use, copy, modify, distribute,
or otherwise deal with the original material in this work for any purpose, without limitation.

In jurisdictions where attribution or other moral rights cannot be fully waived,
the author does not require their name to be displayed beyond the minimal extent required by applicable law,
consents to any use of all original material in this work without personal attribution wherever legally permitted,
and waives any claim or legal action based solely on the absence of attribution,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

This waiver and license does not grant any right to falsely claim authorship of any original material in this work.

Nothing in this license shall be construed as permitting any unlawful use of this work,
or as shielding anyone from criminal liability for such use.

Any permission granted by this license terminates automatically
for any party that initiates or threatens patent litigation
alleging that the original material in this work, or its permitted
use, copy, modification, or distribution infringes any patent.
This termination does not affect the rights of other recipients of this work.

Use at your own risk. The author has no liability for any consequence of using,
misusing, or modifying this work, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

Portions of the conceptual structure, naming conventions, and license assembly were
synthesized in interactive sessions with OpenAI’s ChatGPT.
The AI model acted as a conceptual assistant;
final editorial control remains with the license author for the original text.

Any modifier of this license text assumes sole responsibility and liability for the new license text.

If any provision of this license is held invalid or unenforceable by a court
of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect and be enforceable.
